    "description": "Environmental Engineering major from Chicago. Fall '12 AM Class, BK 1935. Came to Tech for the academics, fell in love with Tech for the campus, city-life, athletics, and culture. Still a big Chicago sports fan but slowly adjusting to the tomahawk chop. Proud alumni of room 204 in the Lambda Chi house, don't think I'll ever want to leave this place. Go Jackets and Go Choppers",
    "aspects": "My favorite aspects of Lambda Chi are definitely the traditions and the great opportunities that the fraternity offers. When it comes to traditions, there's nothing better than gamedays, formal and semiformal, senior stories, our fraternity songs, and all the great brotherhood events we have throughout the year. I can't imagine going to Georgia Tech without all of these. Also, being a Lambda Chi has opened so many doors academically and socially that I wouldn't have had otherwise. I owe much of my GPA, work experience, life experience, and campus involvement to this fraternity.",
