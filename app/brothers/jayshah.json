    "description": "I know that at Lambda Chi, I am always going to have a sweet time, whether its another great party or just chillin with my bros. I am proud to be a part of a fraternity full of a diverse group of highly talented individuals, each with the potential to be as successful as the next. Even more awesome is the fact that every brother at Lambda Chi always has my back and will support me in all my endeavors, be they academic, personal, social, or something else. We have some great times at Lambda Chi, and some of my favorite times here are Formal, Magic Carpet Ride, and most of all, Gamedays.",
