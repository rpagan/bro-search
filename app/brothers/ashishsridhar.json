    "description": "I was born in California and raised in Arizona.  As such, I've always been partial to the West Coast.  Coming to a school situated in the heart of the south was way out of my comfort zone, but joining Lambda Chi made that transition a breeze.  The connections I make with these guys are the connections I'll cherish for the rest of my life.",
